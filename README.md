The approach originally I was goin g to place a RecyclerView with a Retrofit GSon reader to bring the info, but I ended doing it more simple.
Started innvestigating how to implement it with compose, and between StackOverflow and Gemini AI, I ended up creating everything in compose. 
There is a branch called 'db' that I created o n the same Repo, you can check it but it's crashing.
Last thing I added a method to save weverything on a Json local file, but I got bored and it-s saturday, with colapinto racing.
Will check if I can add Unit tests.
